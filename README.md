Snake Game AI â€“ Deep Q-Learning with PyTorch
This project implements an AI agent that learns to play the classic Snake game using Deep Q-Learning (DQL). Built with PyGame for visualization and PyTorch for training a neural network-based Q-learning model, the AI learns optimal movement strategies through interaction with the environment.

Features:
Built from scratch using Python, PyTorch, and PyGame

Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent with experience replay and epsilon-greedy exploration

Custom state space representation for the snake's environment

Reward system that encourages food collection and penalizes collisions

Real-time training and performance tracking

Tech Stack:
Language: Python

Libraries: PyTorch, PyGame, NumPy

Structure:
snake_game.py: Game environment implementation

model.py: Neural network and Q-learning trainer

agent.py: DQN agent logic and training loop

train.py: Main training script


Inspired by DQN concepts from reinforcement learning tutorials. Ideal for anyone looking to understand how AI can learn to play games.
